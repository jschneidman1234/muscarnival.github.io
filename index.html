        <h2>ASSUMPTIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY, RULES, RISKS AND LIABILITY WAIVER AND NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS</h2>
        <h5><u>Assumption of Risks and Assumption of Responsibility/Rules</u></h5>
        <h5><u>I, the undersigned, acknowledge that there are potential risks inherent in my participation in Science Games 2020, held from January 14th, 2020 to January 20th, 2020 (the “Event”). I acknowledge and accept all of the following terms and conditions of participating in the Event:</u></h5>
        <h3>Values and Mentality</h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that the values that Science Games projects and encompasses are equity, respect, friendship, and school spirit. I acknowledge that, as a participant of the Event, I will abide by and act according to these values. This includes, but is not limited to, treating each participant and stakeholder (the McGill community, venues, sponsors, and the Montreal community as a whole) with complete respect, avoiding any and all conflict, and acknowledging that every participant and aforementioned stakeholder is first and foremost a friend, regardless of whether or not they are on an opposing Science Games team. I acknowledge that if I do not abide by these terms, Science Games Committee members reserve the right to immediately remove my bracelet and remove me from the Event and potentially bar me from attending other such events held by the Science Undergraduate Society.</h5>
        <h3>Alcohol</h3> 
        <h5>I acknowledge that the excessive consumption of alcohol taking place during the Event is not recommended and can cause a variety of health problems. I promise to drink responsibly and within my own limits. I accept my responsibility to abide by all the rules as set out by Science Games Committee. I also understand that should my presence at events be seen as a threat to the well-being or safety of myself or others, or should it interfere with the execution of events, Science Games Committee members reserve the right to remove my bracelet and remove me from the Event and potentially bar me from attending other such events held by the Science Undergraduate Society.</h5>
        <h3>Drugs</h3> 
        <h5>I acknowledge that there is a zero tolerance policy towards the use of drugs and non-prescribed medication during the Event. The use of drugs is strictly prohibited and the suspected use of any illegal substances will result in an immediate bracelet cut and removal from the Event. I understand that if I am found guilty of the use of these substances I will be restricted from all future Science Games events and consequences may include university disciplinary action. I acknowledge that if I do witness the use of illegal substances by another participant, I undertake the responsibility to immediately report it to a member of Science Games Committee.</h5>
        <h3>Sexual Harassment And Misconduct</h3>
        <h5>I acknowledge that Science Games regulations and protocols pertaining to sexual harassment and misconduct fall under the McGill Code of Conduct. Any student that is alleged to have violated an article in the Student Code of Conduct may be disciplined by McGill University according to procedures outlined in the Code of Conduct. Sexual harassment can be defined as offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person’s sex; behaviour of a sexual nature that creates an intimidating, unwelcome, hostile or offensive work environment; or behaviour of a sexual nature that could reasonably be thought to put sexual conditions on a person’s job or employment opportunities. I understand that consent is an affirmative decision to engage in mutually agreed upon sexual activity, given by clear words or actions. I understand that consent is a continuous process and can be withdrawn at any point. I understand that consent cannot be agreed to by someone who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or by someone who is unconscious. I understand that consent cannot be forced by the use of threats or by the use of any other sort of pressure by either of the parties involved. I promise to only participate in consensual sexual activity and I understand that should Science Games Committee find reason to believe that I have engaged in any form of misconduct, I will immediately be removed from the Event and a full investigation will take place. Further, I understand that in the case of misconduct of any behavior, the SUS VP Internal may apply restrictions to my involvement within events in the Science Undergraduate Society and share my name with other faculty associations.</h5>
        <h3>Liability Waiver And Indemnification</h3>
        <h5>In consideration of approval to participate in the Event, I and any personal representative, hold unaccountable whoever may be involved in the organization of Science Games 2020, including Science Games Committee, and all of their directors, officers, staff, volunteers, sponsors, agents, trainees, or employees for any and all actions, causes of actions, including negligence, claims, and demands for damages, loss or injury, resulting from or arising out of my participation in the Event.</h5>
        <h3>Non-disclosure Agreement</h3> 
        <h5>I accept to keep confidential, and therefore agree not to disclose under any circumstances, information relative to Science Games 2020. I shall keep confidential all pictures, videos, written documentation or any others records related to the Event. I shall require the written authorization of Science Games Committee in order to publish or share any recording, pictures or documentation related to the event. In the event I violate this non-disclosure agreement, I shall accept to pay $10,000 CAD in damages to the organization following application of this penal clause.</h5>
        <h3>Consequences Of Misconduct</h3>
        <h5>I understand that failure to comply with any of the terms listed in the entirety of the contract may result in the removal of my Science Games 2020 bracelet. My bracelet may be removed at any time by a Science Games Committee member at their sole discretion. I consent to sharing my personal information (such as name, student ID and faculty, and contact information) to McGill Campus Life and Engagement, the Students' Society of McGill University (SSMU) and the other undergraduate societies on campus (including but not limited to Arts Undergraduate Society of McGill University, Engineering Undergraduate Society of McGill University, Management Undergraduate Society of McGill University) for the purpose of ensuring safety at events operated by each of the above organizations. Furthermore, any misconduct at any time which contravenes the Student Handbook on Student Rights and Responsibilities can result in disciplinary action by the McGill administration through the Office of the Dean of Students under an official Memorandum of Understanding between McGill and Science Games.</h5>
        <h3>Previous Misconduct Or Involvement Restriction</h3>          
        <h5>I agree that it is my responsibility to disclose any previous misconducts or involvement restriction to the SUS VP Internal, otherwise further consequences may follow. </h5>
